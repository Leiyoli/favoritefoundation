        <span class="tagline"><i>Best Friends founders took the simple idea that homeless pets should be saved rather than killed, and changed the world of animal welfare.

		  <h3>Adopt Hurcules!</h3>
          <p>Hercules is a super playful dog who loves meeting new people at the Sanctuary. At Dogtown, he loves meeting and playing with new dogs and has demonstrated amazing dog skills. He will adapt to other dogs' play styles, but he does love to roughhouse, run and jump around. He spends some of his time in our Headquarters offices, and snuggling on the couch is his favorite past time.</p>
		  <p>Hercules was born in 2016 and came to the Sanctuary from a Best Friends Network partner shelter in Florida. Because he has bitten in the past, he will need a dog-savvy, adult-only household. An active home would also be best for Hercules, though he does know when it's time to chill out and relax.</p>

          <h2>Sponsor a Pet in Need</h2>
            <p>As a sponsor, you will help provide care and support for a homeless pet (like Sophia Loren).</p>

            <h4>Meet the stunning Sophia Loren!</h4>
            <p>Sophia is a gorgeous Belgian Malinois. She is majestic and a tad bit aloof. And while every dog is an individual, her aloofness is a trait of her breed. Sophia needs to have a minute to take a look at you before she decides to be friends. For about five minutes she carefully observed me while I visited with the rest of her run. Evidently I passed muster and our friendship was sealed by a quick sloppy kiss to my ear.</p>
            <p>Your gift will help your sponsored pet — and all of the other pets around the country who are touched by the work of Best Friends.</p>

          <h2>No-Kill Nationwide by 2025</h2>
            <p>There is a lifesaving path forward. To the nearly 2,200 dogs and cats killed every day in animal shelters, we’ve made a pledge: <strong>We will reach no-kill in this country by 2025. </strong>Working collaboratively with shelters, other animal welfare organizations and you, we can Save Them All.</p>
